# Mapbox GL JS Point Plotter

This project showcases the ability to implement Mapbox GL JS library in unique ways to plot points on a map. It was built during my first ever hackathon and helped improve my technical communication skills by explaining the code to others.

## Overview

The Mapbox GL JS Point Plotter is a simple web application that allows users to plot points on a map using the Mapbox GL JS library. The application allows users to zoom in and out, pan around the map, and plot points by clicking on the map.

## Requirements

A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
An API key for Mapbox
## Getting Started

Clone or download the repository.
Open index.html in your web browser.
Enter your Mapbox API key in the text input.
Use the scroll wheel to zoom and pan controls to navigate to the desired location on the map.
Right click on the map to plot a point. A pin/marker will be added to the map at the location of the click.
## Usage

### Plotting Points
To plot a point on the map, simply right click on the desired location. A pin/marker will be added to the map at the location of the click.

### Zooming and Panning
To zoom in or out, use the scroll wheel. To pan around the map, click and drag the map with your mouse.
